firmware_150130_r775
====================

Update: Several people still report problems. So don't use this version.
A new release will be prepared asap.

This file has shortly been revoked (briefly renamed to
firmware_150130_r775_BROKEN_DONT_USE.upg) since on two machines the
update process failed and the board didn't boot at all, anymore. Later
tests didn't manage to reproduce this problem. So it's for now assumed
that this problem was causes by a faulty file on the SD card or similar.

However, from now on also the .bin version of the firmware is being released
to directly allow to re-flash a board to the latest firmware after a failed
update attempt. The usage of the .bin file is explained in the wiki under
http://code.google.com/p/mist-board/wiki/HowToInstallTheFirmware#Updating_the_IO_controller_via_SAM-BA_under_Windows

Changes in this version
-----------------------

This version introduces first support functions for the upcoming Acorn
Archimedes core.

This firmware suppoerts the latest changes in the Atari ST DMA and
ACSI implementation and comes with a 16 bit DMA FIFO and supports the
ICD protocol for harddisks bigger than 1GB.

This firmware also supports a global ini file named mist.ini to be placed on
SD card with fundamental parameters not configurable via the OSD. Currently
only the minimig aga core supports this. If a mist.ini file with the 
following contents is placed on the card:

[mist]
scandoubler_disable=1

Then the minimig aga core disables its scan doubler and generates a TV
compatible 15khz signal. It is planned that other cores also make use of this
feature.
