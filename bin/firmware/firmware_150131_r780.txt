firmware_150131_r780
====================

This version fixes a severe bug in the self-update routines.

This version introduces first support functions for the upcoming Acorn
Archimedes core.

This firmware suppoerts the latest changes in the Atari ST DMA and
ACSI implementation and comes with a 16 bit DMA FIFO and supports the
ICD protocol for harddisks bigger than 1GB.

This firmware also supports a global ini file named mist.ini to be placed on
SD card with fundamental parameters not configurable via the OSD. Currently
only the minimig aga core supports this. If a mist.ini file with the 
following contents is placed on the card:

[mist]
scandoubler_disable=1

Then the minimig aga core disables its scan doubler and generates a TV
compatible 15khz signal. It is planned that other cores also make use of this
feature.
