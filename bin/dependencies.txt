Cores and firmware on the MIST board have a close relationship. Some
changes in the firmware may have a counterpart in the core and vice
versa. This may result in the fact that a core may not work with an older
firmware anymore or that a newer firmware also needs a newer core.

This document tries to collect these dependencies.
