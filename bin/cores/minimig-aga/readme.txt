Minimig-AGA for MIST (BETA)
---------------------------

This is a beta release of Rok Krajnc's AGA extension of the Minimig core.

This is a work in progress and many things will still need fixing. 

Recommended kickstart is Kickstart v3.1 rev 40.63 (A500-A600-A2000)

You'll need the latest firmware to run this.

Optionally put the three files minimig.art, minimig.bal and
minimig.cop into the SD cards root directory for a nice boot
animation.
