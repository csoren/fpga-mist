ZX01/ZX81 core for MIST quick start guide
-----------------------------------------

Update to the latest firmware (using e.g. a Atari ST core) and copy the 
latest ZX01 core to SD card. Name the core "core.rbf" and place it in the
SD cards root.

Add some ZX81 programs (*.p) files to the SD card.

Put the SD card into the MIST and boot it. After a few seconds you
should see the familiar white screen with the inverted K in the lower
left corner. 

You ZX81 is up and running. 

How to load a file
------------------

The ZX81 originally used cassette tapes for mass storage. Unlike most
emulators the MIST emulates the audio signal of the cassette tape.

To load a program you first need to load it into the "tape buffer" of
the MIST. To do that you need to open the OSD using F12 and then
select "Load *.p" and select the file you want to load. Loading takes
very long so a short 1k program is recommanded for the first tests.

Now the tape drive is ready. Enter 'load ""' by first pressing the 'j'
key and then two times SHIFT-'p'. Press return. The screen will switch
off since the tape loading logic of a ZX81 re-uses parts of the video
system. Old TV sets displayed some flickering black and white
lines. Modern screen don't cope at all with this. This is ok.

Now start the tape replay by pressing the rightmost button on the
MISTs front panel. If you have speakers connected to your MIST you'll
hear the audio signal generated by the tape drive. Also the yellow LED
starts flickering. After roughly 30 seconds for a 1K program the
loading will be done and the ZX81 video will come back to live. Some
programs will auto start. For some others you'll have to hit 'r' and
return to run them.

Limitations
-----------

The ZX81 video is party generated via the CPU. A perfect CPU timing is
thus required for perfect video. This is true for simple text modes
but it's even more critical with hirez video modes.

Unfortunately the zx01 core and its CPU aren't perfect. Some programs
will have a slighly distorted video signal timing. Some screens cope
better with this, some don't ...
