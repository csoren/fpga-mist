Sega Master System Core for MiST
--------------------------------

This core is a port of Bens Sega Master System implementation for the
Papilio. See http://fpga-hacks.blogspot.de/

The core has been adopted to the MiST upload logic so cartridge images
can be uploaded via the MIST OSD as usual. To run a cartridge image
press F12 to open the OSD. Select a *.SMS file for upload. The core
will automatically be restarted after upload, so the cartridge is
started immediately.

It's recommended to use a USB joystick or gamepad with more the one
fire button since many SMS games expect a second fire button.
