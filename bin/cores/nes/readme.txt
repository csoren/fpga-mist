NES core for MiST
-----------------

This is a port of Luddes NES core to the MIST. See his FPGANES blog at
http://fpganes.blogspot.de for details. The original source code can
be found at https://github.com/strigeus/fpganes

You need a USB game pad with at least 2 buttons to run NES games. With
4 buttons SELECT and START will also be mapped. For pads with two buttons
START and SELECT can also be reached from the OSD.
